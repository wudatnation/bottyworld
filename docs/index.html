<div class="textblock"><p><em>bottyworld</em> is a 2D simulation of robot named "botty" that includes an intruder and a recharging battery. The creator is <a href="https://github.com/wudatnation">David Wu</a>, student in <a href="https://github.com/klavins/ECEP520">ECEP520 (a.k.a. ECE590) - Software Engineering for Embedded Applications)</a>, for which the professor is <a href="https://github.com/klavins/">Eric Klavins</a>. This program was David's final project for this course.</p>
<p>NOTE: Be sure that your computer's sound is operational, and that the volume is turned up to a medium volume.</p>
<h2>Execution </h2>
<p>To run <em>bottyworld</em>, type </p><pre class="fragment">bin/bottyworld
</pre><h2>Operation </h2>
<p>When the <em>bottyworld</em> environment appears, botty is represented by "b". As he moves rather quickly in random directions throughout his world, his battery power dissipates.</p>
<p>You can influence the environment of <em>bottyworld</em> via these keys:</p><ul>
<li><b>i</b>: Introduce Intruder<ul>
<li>The Intruder appears, represented by "I". When this happens, botty makes a noise to indicate that he is indeed aware of the Intruder.</li>
<li>If botty moves to within the proximity of the Intruder, botty will turn into an "E" and purposely evade the Intruder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>r</b>: Reset<ul>
<li>If you reset while botty is in an evasive "E" mode, botty will turn back into "b", but botty will make a noise indicating that he knows the intruder is still there.</li>
<li>If you reset while botty is in his regular "b" mode, the Intruder will disappear!</li>
<li>NOTE: Resetting does NOT affect the battery's power and recharging operation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>q</b>: Quit</li>
</ul>
<h2>Architecture </h2>
<p>This project was intended to be an extension of the robot finite state machine, introduced to our class in Week 7 homework. The elma_project file structure, provided by Prof. Klavins, was used as the baseline for the project. The latest "elma:latest" docker container for compiling.</p>
<p>Using ncurses for the first time, I spent a lot of time learning how this application works, and I also spent a few days learning how the base elma_project handled states and transitions. A considerable amount of time and effort was spent figuring out how to convert the Homework 7 representation of the FSM, and convert it into the elma_project-style structure.</p>
<h2>Results </h2>
<p>Part of the challenge of this project was the intepretation of the robot FSM, and how it can be represented in a user interface. I was able to get the Wander, Make Noise, and Evade states operating correctly, as well as the transitions between each.</p>
<p>I diverged from the original FSM to create a method of battery operation that was slightly more efficient (and aesthetically pleasing) than what I would have had to implement using the original structure.</p>
<p>I found that I worked best when I focused on getting a particular feature to work, as opposed to working on multiple integrated features at once. I made sure to save, for configuration management, the various successful stages of coding.</p>

<h1>Historical Sections from Week 8 &amp; 9 Homework</h1>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>ECE590 has been a challenging but also very rewarding course, and I (David Wu) hope to showcase what I have learned these past 10 weeks in this final project. For whatever reason, the idea of moving the FSM robot (part of homework from Week 7) into a 2D environment is the project option that caught my attention.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Please take note that the goals and other details listed below are subject to change/evolve as the project matures.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>My goals for <em>bottyworld</em> are as follows:</p><ul>
<li>Successfully simulate Botty in a 2D environment, in which Botty wanders in random directions per second.</li>
<li>Include an intruder that Botty will respond to.</li>
<li>Include a recharge station that will bring Botty back up to full power.</li>
<li>Allow an external operator to reset the environment.</li>
<li>Export visual data per second.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Projected Resources</h2>
<p>I project that I will use the following resources:</p><ul>
<li>Elma</li>
<li>robot FSM code determined in Week 7 homework</li>
<li>StateMachine class (C++)</li>
<li>chrono sub-namespace</li>
<li><a href="http://google.com">Google.com</a>, to search for solutions to coding problems as they arise</li>
<li>Input from other students - not to "copy" ideas but to gain some insight in terms of approach, as they also work on their final projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Homework 9 / Answer to Question 3</h2>
<p>This past week, I have been brainstorming on how I will approach the 2-dimensional space that Botty will wander in, as well as reviewing the elma_project files and structure.</p>
<p>I project that I will be creating a 10 x 10 grid that looks similar to the following:</p>
<p>= = = = = = = = = =</p>
<p>= = = = = = = = = =</p>
<p>= B = = = = = = = =</p>
<p>= = = = = = = = = =</p>
<p>= = = = = = = = = =</p>
<p>= = = = = = = = = =</p>
<p>= = = = = = I = = =</p>
<p>= = = = = = = = = =</p>
<p>= = = = = = = = = =</p>
<p>= = = = = = = = = ^</p>
<p>Here is an explanation of the characters in the grid. Note that these might be replaced by other characters depending on the capability of ncurses:</p><ul>
<li><b>B</b> of course is Botty himself. Botty will start at the upper-right corner (0,0) and then will wander through the grid in a random direction each second.</li>
<li><b>I</b> is the intruder. When Botty gets close to the introder, he will go into the "evade" state.</li>
<li>**^** is the recharge station. When Botty gets close to losing battery power, he will move towards the recharge station to get re-energized. Also, if Botty wanders into the recharge station, it will recharge. I still haven't decided if Botty will keep on "going and going", or if he will die if it doesn't reach the recharge station in time.</li>
</ul>
<p>My <em>updated</em> milestones for this project are as follows:</p><ul>
<li>Compile elma_project (base template for bottyworld structure). <em>Complete</em></li>
<li>Study ncurses. <em>In Progress</em> (ECD: Mon., 3/18)</li>
<li>Set up the 2D grid. (ECD: Tue., 3/19)</li>
<li>Enable Botty to wander in random directions per second. (ECD: Tue., 3/19)</li>
<li>Place intruder and recharge station in environment. (ECD: Tue., 3/19)</li>
<li>Complete 2D graphical representation/export of data per second. (ECD: Wed., 3/20)</li>
<li>Successfully implement all states of FSM. (ECD: Wed., 3/20)</li>
<li>Complete API documentation. (ECD: Thurs., 3/21)</li>
<li>Complete/submit final project. (ECD: Fri., 3/22)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Homework 9 / Answer to Question 4</h2>
<p>I also started learning how ncurses works, and also have been studying the way that elma_project works. I can get the base elma_project to compile properly in the latest docker container made available by Prof. Klavins. (At the time of this writing, the code in the above structure here compiles fine.)</p>
<p>At this point, I am still figuring out how to "convert" the given stopwatch example in elma_project to become the template for bottyworld. </p>
