# bottyworld
**_bottyworld_** will be a simulation of robot named "Botty" in a 2D environment that includes an intruder and a recharge station. The author of this ongoing final course project is David Wu, student in [ECEP520 (a.k.a. ECE590) - Software Engineering for Embedded Applications)](https://github.com/klavins/ECEP520), for which the professor is [Eric Klavins](https://github.com/klavins/).

## Motivation
ECE590 has been a challenging but also very rewarding course, and I (David Wu) hope to showcase what I have learned these past 10 weeks in this final project.  For whatever reason, the idea of moving the FSM robot (part of homework from Week 7) into a 2D environment is the project option that caught my attention.

## Disclaimer
Please take note that the goals and other details listed below are subject to change/evolve as the project matures.

## Goals
My goals for _bottyworld_ are as follows:
* Successfully simulate Botty in a 2D environment, in which Botty wanders in random directions per second.
* Include an intruder that Botty will respond to.
* Include a recharge station that will bring Botty back up to full power.
* Allow an external operator to reset the environment.
* Export visual data per second.

## Projected Resources
I project that I will use the following resources:
* Elma
* robot FSM code determined in Week 7 homework
* StateMachine class (C++)
* chrono sub-namespace
* [Google.com](http://google.com), to search for solutions to coding problems as they arise
* Input from other students - not to "copy" ideas but to gain some insight in terms of approach, as they also work on their final projects.

## Projected Milestones
I project the following milestones for this project:
* Set up the 2D grid. (ECD: Wed., 3/13)
* Enable Botty to wander in random directions per second. (ECD: Sat., 3/16)
* Place intruder and recharge station in environment. (ECD: Sun., 3/17)
* Complete 2D graphical representation/export of data per second.  (ECD: Mon., 3/18)
* Find a decent and working solution for displaying/exporting visual data of the 2D grid per second. (ECD: Tue., 3/19)
* Complete API documentation.  (ECD: Thurs., 3/21)
* Complete/submit final project. (ECD: Fri., 3/22)
